# 🧪 JavaScript Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly JavaScript mini-projects created during my journey of learning JavaScript. Each folder focuses on a specific concept or DOM interaction.

These projects are not deployed — they are here for **learning purposes**, both for myself and for anyone who wants to explore and build similar things. 🚀
